## 1. OPENING - ELEVATOR PITCH (30 SECONDS MAX)



Hi guys, it's 5 AM here but we had to publish this because it cannot wait.

**Problem:** Current AI hallucinates. You can't trust it for anything important. Big companies get away with it because they only use AI for low-stakes decisions where errors don't matter. High-stakes stuff? Still needs humans.

**Solution:** We built SPL—a language that enables AI to answer right and shows you how it got there. And we're about to launch SPLiQ, the first quantum AGI. From now on you will experience the new Real AI, which you can trust.

That's it. Now let me tell you how we got here.

## 2. OUR STORY - 5 PEOPLE DOING WORK OF 500



We're a small team, you know super ninjas in everything, from advanced automation to advertising. We wanted 5 people to do the work of 500. We were building a nanny AI, an immigration lawyer AI, and an Amazon seller assistant.

We built a powerful orchestrator—something that could coordinate complex AI workflows. But then we hit a wall: we needed a universal language so the orchestrator could do anything. Not just chat, not just one task—everything.

Current AI hallucinates. You can't ship that. A nanny that gives wrong safety advice? An immigration lawyer that makes up laws? An Amazon seller with wrong financials? 

We needed AI we could actually trust. AI that proves it's right, not just sounds confident. That's how we got to SPL—the universal language our orchestrator needed.

## 3. WHAT IS SPL - TRUTH SCORES ON EVERYTHING




SPL is the quantum AGI language where every output has a verifiable truth score. Instead of hoping the AI is right, you get proof. Output + truth score + evidence. Every time.

Here's the key difference: Current AI is linear—you prompt, it generates, done. That's not real AI. That's autocomplete on steroids.

SPL builds AND validates. The LLM suggests an answer, then validators check it. Code execution, API calls, theorem provers. The LLM proposes, the system verifies. That's how you get Real AI—not just generation, but guaranteed correctness.

Twenty foundational patterns compose into millions. No massive resources needed. Everyone can build verifiable AI, not just companies with millions to burn.

## 4. THE HARD DECISION - PUBLISHING THIS (SPEAK FROM THE HEART)





**This is important - speak from the heart:**

Look, we struggled with this decision. SPL can be used for good and bad. Verifiable AI in the wrong hands? That's powerful.

But after months of thinking about it, we realized: if we keep this hidden, only we have it. And maybe bad actors figure it out anyway, in secret, with no accountability.

By publishing it open source—Apache 2.0, everything public—we're betting that the good will outpace the bad. That doctors, researchers, small businesses, developers building helpful things will move faster than anyone trying to misuse it.

Transparency over secrecy. Community validation over hiding in a lab. This needs to be out there so we can develop the good applications fast enough to outpace any wrongdoing.

That's why we're here. That's why it's open.

## 5. REAL EXAMPLES - WHAT BECOMES POSSIBLE

Factory robots showing exactly why they stopped. Hospitals with confidence scores on every diagnosis. Banks showing their fraud detection reasoning. Mars exploration with fully autonomous fleets that can be trusted. Quantum computers being managed by verifiable AI. Scientific research that can prove its discoveries.

This is what becomes possible when AI can prove it's right.

## 6. THE VALIDATOR SOLUTION - CAN LLMS LIE?




Can LLMs lie about truth scores? Yes. That's why patterns have external validators. LLM suggests, code verifies. Architecture over hope.

## 7. SPLiQ - OUR COMPANY AND WHAT'S COMING




We're SPLiQ. We built SPL and now we're rolling out [spliq.ai](https://spliq.ai)—our implementation of SPL.

Coming soon:
- Chat interface where you can interact with SPL patterns
- API access to our SPL implementation
- Enterprise solutions for companies that need verifiable AI in production

SPL is open source. SPLiQ is how we're bringing it to everyone. Free tier for interaction, enterprise support for companies that need it.

## 8. CLOSING - CALL TO ACTION



Everything's on GitHub. Apache 2.0. Now we need the community.

Domain experts, skeptics, builders, early adopters—try it, break it, tell us what's wrong.

Link in description. Link in HN announcement. Link in the repo README.

Because AI without verification isn't intelligence. And AI hidden in labs isn't helping anyone.

Let's build Real AI, together.
