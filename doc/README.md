## Welcome to SPL

**SPL (Semantic Pattern Language)** is the quantum AGI language where every output has a verifiable truth score.

This documentation will help you understand what SPL is, why it works, and how to use it.

### New to SPL?

**[What is SPL?](spl/what-is-spl.md)** - Start here to understand SPL fundamentals
- Quantum mathematics for context-aware truth
- Six cognitive patterns that enable AGI
- How patterns compose exponentially
- Why SPL makes AI verifiable

## 📚 Core Concepts

### Understanding SPL

**[What is Real AI?](spl/what-is-real-ai.md)**
- Why LLMs alone aren't intelligent
- The seven properties of real intelligence
- How SPL transforms "dumb muscles" into real AI
- Real AI = LLM + SPL

**[SPL Three Pillars](spl/spl-three-pillars.md)**
- LLM Layer (the muscle)
- Action Layer (the structure)
- Guarantees (the safety)
- How they work together

**[SPL and Quantum](spl/spl-and-quantum.md)**
- Why quantum mathematics?
- Superposition, collapse, interference
- Context-dependent truth
- Quantum math, not quantum hardware

**[SPL and AGI](spl/spl-and-agi.md)**
- What is AGI really?
- The six cognitive patterns (L1C)
- Why these six = general intelligence
- How SPLiQ is building AGI with minimal layers

---

## 🏗️ Architecture

### The Six Layers

**[SPL Six Layers Overview](patterns/spl-six-layers-overview.md)**
- Complete architecture from L0 to L5
- How layers multiply capabilities
- Exponential growth from minimal foundation

### Current Release: Foundational Patterns (L0 + L1 + L1C)

**[L0: Meta-Pattern](patterns/what-is-l0-meta-pattern.md)** - The foundation (1 pattern)

**[L1: Critical Patterns](patterns/what-are-l1-critical-patterns.md)** - Universal building blocks (13 patterns)

**[L1C: Cognitive Patterns](patterns/what-are-l1c-cognitive-patterns.md)** - AGI capabilities (6 patterns)

### Future Layers (Coming Soon)

The architecture supports additional layers that build on these foundations:

**L2: Reality Patterns** - Digital, physical, and hybrid specializations  
**L3: Technology Patterns** - Concrete implementations (React, PyTorch, ROS, etc.)  
**L4: Products** - Reusable contract definitions  
**L5: Solutions** - Complete deployed implementations  

See [L2: Reality Patterns](patterns/what-are-l2-reality-patterns.md), [L3: Technology Patterns](patterns/what-are-l3-technology-patterns.md), [L4: Products](patterns/what-are-l4-products.md), and [L5: Solutions](patterns/what-are-l5-solutions.md) for architectural guidance.

## 💡 The Big Picture

**SPL solves the fundamental problem with AI today:**

❌ **Current AI:** Black box, unverifiable, can't reason, can't learn continuously  
✅ **SPL:** Glass box, verifiable truth scores, compositional reasoning, continuous learning

**The formula:**
```
LLM (muscle) + SPL (brain) + L1C patterns (consciousness) = Real AGI
```

**The result:**
- Quantum mathematics for context-aware truth
- Six cognitive patterns for general intelligence  
- Exponential growth from minimal layers
- Every output verifiable

**This is how we build AGI you can trust.**

**The Truth:** AI wasn't born until SPL was born. Because AI without verification, without context-awareness, without cognitive architecture—that's not intelligence. That's sophisticated mimicry.

**Welcome to real AI.** Welcome to SPL.
