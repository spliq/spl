  title: Reality Bridge (Core)
  description: Core pattern for interfacing between multiple realities simultaneously
    or handling blurred reality boundaries

contract:
  goal: Enable communication, translation, and synchronization across multiple realities
    simultaneously
  return_format: Multi-reality interface specification with mappings and synchronization
    rules
  warnings:
  - Reality boundaries may be ambiguous or overlapping
  - Synchronization across realities may have latency
  - Some concepts may not have equivalents in all realities
  - Reality perception may be subjective or observer-dependent
  context:
  - Layer 1 core reality bridge pattern
  - Reality-agnostic (meta-reality)
  - Foundation for telepathy, dreams, XR, consciousness transfer
  - Extends translator pattern to handle multiple realities

selection:
  preferred_models: []

  constraints:
  - Use when dealing with multiple simultaneous realities
  - Requires clear reality boundary definitions
  - May need subjective validation methods
execution:
  steps:
  - Identify all realities to be bridged
  - Analyze reality properties and access protocols
  - Define cross-reality mappings
  - Establish synchronization mechanisms
  - Implement translation for each reality pair
  - Handle incompatibilities and edge cases
  - Validate bridge fidelity
  - Monitor and maintain synchronization
guarantees:
  success_criteria:
  - All realities are accessible through unified interface
  - Mappings preserve as much information as possible
  - Synchronization meets latency requirements
  - Incompatibilities are documented

  rubric:
    pass:
    - All specified realities connected
    - Fidelity meets requirements
    - Synchronization within latency tolerance
    - Incompatibilities handled gracefully
    fail:
    - Cannot access one or more realities
    - Unacceptable information loss
    - Synchronization too slow
    - Unhandled incompatibilities
